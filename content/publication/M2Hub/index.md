abstract: "We introduce M2Hub, a toolkit for advancing machine learning in materials discovery. Machine learning has achieved remarkable progress in modeling molecular structures, especially biomolecules for drug discovery. However, the development of machine learning approaches for modeling materials structures lag behind, which is partly due to the lack of an integrated platform that enables access to diverse tasks for materials discovery. To bridge this gap, M2Hub will enable easy access to materials discovery tasks, datasets, machine learning methods, evaluations, and benchmark results that cover the entire workflow. Specifically, the first release of M2Hub focuses on three key stages in materials discovery: virtual screening, inverse design, and molecular simulation, including 9 datasets that covers 6 types of materials with 56 tasks across 8 types of material properties. We further provide 2 synthetic datasets for the purpose of generative tasks on materials. In addition to random data splits, we also provide 3 additional data partitions to reflect the real-world materials discovery scenarios. State-of-the-art machine learning methods (including those are suitable for materials structures but never compared in the literature) are benchmarked on representative tasks. Our codes and library are publicly available at https://github.com/yuanqidu/M2Hub."
